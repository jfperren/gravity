# Gravity

A Java game about stars and gravitation

## Description

Gravity is my first ever Java project. It was done as a Baccalaureat project in 2nd year High School (2010), and at the time I had absoluetly no programmation knowledge at all (which explains why it is so badly coded). Nevertheless, I learned a lot through the process and I believe that coding this little game is what first awoke my interest for Computer Science.

In order to make the code readable, I have started to rewrite it, but it is far from being finished at the moment. You can find here both the old legacy project and the new WIP.

Don't hesitate to write me if you have comments/ideas or if you want to improve it. :)
